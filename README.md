# Churn_Prediction

This work has been done to calculate the probability of customers churn using the Telcom Dataset. Algorithms such as glm, Logistic Regression and XGBoost habe been used.

The code here is based on the tutorial from https://towardsdatascience.com/data-driven-growth-with-python-part-1-know-your-metrics-812781e66a5b
